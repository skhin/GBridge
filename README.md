SEI33 (SG) Project1: Glass Bridge

Squid Game is a South Korean Netflix drama phenomenon that has taken the world by storm.

Initially, I could not find anyone else on Google who had coded the Glass Bridge game (though there were quite a few that did the Red Light Green Light game). (I did not think to look on Github, and 2 more days to my presentation, was when I found other sources, but by then I had nearly completed the project)

Capitalizing on its popularity, and my own imagination, I decided to tackle this challenge.

Squid Game's 5th challenge in episode 7 features the players crossing a faulty glass bridge (one set of tempered and normal glass per row)

Players are tasked to choose either the right or left set without knowing which will cause them to fall to their death.

Challenges:

1. Laying out the visuals - It was easy to do this via powerpoint when I had to present it. Executing it was another issue as CSS is not my strong suit.

2. Ramdomizing the tiles per set and ensuring the previous tile was remembered - Took me a long time to figure this out. Took a lot of inspiration from coded chess games and whack-a-moles and online tutorials to determine how to move on this.

3. I wanted to create a drop down page where if the player wins or they lose their lives, it would hide the game and ask the player to restart.

Moving forward:

1. Compressing the game so it fits into both mobile and desktop versions - it takes up 1.5page on the desktop when ideally I would like it to be just one page only.

2. Making the code DRY-er so that I can call the game function each time quickly.

3. Improving on the visuals of it as well as possibly adding in animation when I learn how to do it more.

4. I would like to animate more of the selections and buttons with some transorms later on, once my CSS knowledge grows.
